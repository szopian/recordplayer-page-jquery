        <p></br></br>It was in 1887 that the gramophone was invented, which became the basis for the modern record player.</br></br>The popularity of music in the 50s and 60s ensured that the record player was just as popular as the radio.</br> They were always referred to as "record players"; to use the old-fashioned term "gramophone" in the late 50s and early 60s marked you out as a member of the square, older generation.</p>
